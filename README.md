# Business Case Study
This report aims to solve two part business problems dealing with two businesses and reccommend a business solution using Decision Science. The two businesses are as follows,
1. **Autonomous Shipment** roll-out: Autonomous Delivery
2. **Drinks@home.uk**: What makes a customer valuable?

## Part 1: Autonomous Shipment

### Objectives:
Autonomous Shipment, a start-up venture, aims to use robot drones for last-minute deliveries to
the customer’s doorsteps. Before the official launch, the company wants to run a trial in Grocery, Clothing and Sports stores 
to find its efficiency. The company has developed four robot prototypes: Robot A032 – Archer, Robot B23 – Bowler,
Robot CJKL – Corner and Robot DSXX – Deviant. We have a limited budget of £250,000 for the
one-month project. We have two decisions to make. They are,
1. Decide on a robot for the trial run based on the requirements.
2. Allocate the number of robots to maximise delivery and be under budget.
